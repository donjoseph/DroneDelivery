Feature: Verify that the program gives the most efficient schedule and NPS for 
valid orders in the input array


 @Scenario1_testCase1
  Scenario: Verify that the program gives the most efficient schedule and NPS for
  valid orders of different order received time and different customer coordinates
  Given get the input array with data
  |WM001 N11W5 05:11:50|
  |WM002 S3E2 05:11:55|
  |WM003 N7E5 05:31:50|
  |WM004 N11E5 06:11:50|
  And set the output file to "Scenario1_testCase1"
  And do the input validation
  When run the scheduler
  Then validate the output file of "Scenario1_testCase1"

  @Scenario1_testCase2
  Scenario: Verify that the program gives the most efficient schedule and NPS for
  valid orders of same order received time and different customer coordinates
  Given get the input array with data

  And do the input validation
  When run the scheduler
  Then validate the output file of "Scenario1_testCase2"

  @Scenario1_testCase3
  Scenario: Verify that the program gives the most efficient schedule and NPS for
  valid orders of same order received time and same customer coordinates
  Given get the input array with data
  |WM001 N2W5 06:11:50|

  |WM003 N2E5 06:11:50|
  |WM004 N5E2 06:11:50|
  And set the output file to "Scenario1_testCase3"
  And do the input validation
  When run the scheduler
  Then validate the output file of "Scenario1_testCase3"


  @Scenario1_testCase4
  Scenario: Verify that the program gives the most efficient schedule and NPS for
  valid orders in which there is a huge time gap between each orders
  Given get the input array with data
  |WM001 N2W5 05:11:50|
  |WM002 S2E5 07:11:50|
  |WM003 N2E5 09:11:50|
  |WM004 N5E2 12:11:50|
  And set the output file to "Scenario1_testCase4"
  And do the input validation
  When run the scheduler
  Then validate the output file of "Scenario1_testCase4"

  @Scenario1_testCase5
  Scenario: Verify that the program gives the most efficient schedule and NPS for
  valid orders in which there is at least one order which will be a neutral customer
  and the rest promoters.
  Given get the input array with data
  |WM001 N1W5 05:11:50|
  |WM002 S50E30 05:12:50|
  |WM003 N2E12 08:11:50|

  And set the output file to "Scenario1_testCase5"
  And do the input validation
  When run the scheduler
  Then validate the output file of "Scenario1_testCase5"

  @Scenario1_testCase6
  Scenario: Verify that the program gives the most efficient schedule and NPS for
  valid orders in which there is at least one order which will be a detractor customer
  and the rest promoters.
  Given get the input array with data
  |WM005 N12E14 05:08:50|
  |WM004 N50E20 06:08:50|

  |WM002 S2E4 16:12:50|
  And set the output file to "Scenario1_testCase6"
  And do the input validation
  When run the scheduler
  Then validate the output file of "Scenario1_testCase6"

  @Scenario1_testCase7
  Scenario: Verify that the program gives the most efficient schedule and NPS for
  valid orders in which there is at least one order each which will be a detractor customer
  and a neutral customer and the rest promoters.
  Given get the input array with data
  |WM001 N1W5 06:11:50|
  |WM002 S50E110 07:11:50|

  And do the input validation
  When run the scheduler
  Then validate the output file of "Scenario1_testCase7"
  
  @Scenario1_testCase8
